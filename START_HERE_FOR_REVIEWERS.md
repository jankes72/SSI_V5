## SSI V5 implementation update — 2026-09-20

SSI V5 contains the implemented DIRECTOR Technology Radar path, extended LEGO Pocket, Pocket Micro, META-LEGO, Contract Binding and the corresponding V5 interface. These capabilities follow the earlier recorded architecture and development plan.

```text
IMPLEMENTED
= Technology Radar / discovery path
+ need and novelty matching
+ LEGO Pocket candidate intake
+ Pocket Micro + META-LEGO routing/evidence layer
+ Contract Binding
+ V5 interface integration
+ independent DIRECTOR runtime
+ 7/7 BODY-family runtime availability

S11 TERMINAL GATE
= smoke after META-LEGO PASS
+ 22 full-run cases PASS
+ 0 FAIL
+ 1 INCONCLUSIVE at S11-04-05
+ native evaluation at stop PASS
+ Collective Intelligence INCONCLUSIVE / PARTIAL
+ full S11 PASS NOT CLAIMED
+ S12-S40 NOT YET CLAIMED

ŚWIAT PIŁKI — HIPNOZA
= IMPLEMENTED / OPERATOR-OBSERVED
+ complete data-path validation PENDING
+ evidence-backed domain validation PENDING
```

The full Radar → candidate → LAB → evidence → decision → regression → transfer lifecycle is not yet claimed as validated end-to-end. Pocket entries remain candidates until their applicable validation gates close. BODY_FROZEN and DIRECTOR retain separate runtime, memory and lifecycle. See [the terminal S11 record](RESULTS/SSI_V5_CONTROLLED_EVOLUTION_LIVE_S11_20260920.md) and [the V5 implementation report](RESULTS/SSI_V5_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_20260920.md).

## Why this project is now collaboration-ready

The preserved 2026-09-17 V4 run established a complete controlled software cycle with seven BODY development lines, S1-S10 progression, consolidation/promotion/bridge gates, regression verification, rollback accounting, promoted-state reload verification and post-training domain execution.

The 2026-09-18 Dual Mother milestone adds a separate cross-domain evidence layer:

- two independent domain-side controllers;
- paired scenario execution with deterministic repetition;
- validation-gated cross consolidation;
- dynamic plan invalidation;
- checkpoint rollback;
- second cross-domain consultation;
- conservative replanning followed by validation;
- recorded timings and explicit claim boundaries.

This makes externally defined falsification, replication and cross-domain challenge design more concrete than a roadmap-only collaboration.

## Dual Mother scenario split

### M01-M06 — validation followed by cross consolidation

```text
detect
-> micronetwork sync
-> assess
-> decision
-> action
-> validate
-> cross consolidation
```

### M07-M12 — dynamic failure, rollback and second consultation

```text
checkpoint
-> action
-> dynamic evidence
-> plan invalidation
-> rollback
-> second cross consultation
-> conservative replan
-> validation
```

Rescue Robot Mother is non-humanoid in this laboratory. Measured specialist classes include `MOLE_DRILLER`, `TRACKED_CRAWLER`, `SNAKE_SCOUT`, `QUADRUPED`, `AMPHIBIOUS_CRAWLER` and `HEAT_SHIELDED_CRAWLER`.

## External collaboration model

Preferred model:

```text
EXTERNAL PARTNER DEFINES A PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN PROBLEM
-> ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FROZEN BEFORE RUN
-> SSI EXECUTION
-> PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE PRESERVED
-> EVIDENCE / TIMINGS / FAILURES RETAINED
-> OPTIONAL CONSOLIDATION
-> TARGET-SPECIFIC RE-VALIDATION
-> RESULT RETURNED TO PARTNER
```

Possible partner roles include:

- research collaborator;
- consortium partner / beneficiary where programme rules permit;
- external challenge designer;
- independent replication / validation partner;
- continual-learning or multi-agent methods reviewer;
- drone/swarm research laboratory;
- specialist rescue-robotics laboratory;
- humanoid/robotics research laboratory;
- later physical validation partner.

## Current architecture summary

SSI is a persistent multi-agent software ecosystem containing:

```text
DIRECTOR
+ BODY_FROZEN
+ ISKRA1..ISKRA6
+ HERMES
+ CONTINUUM
+ ROUTER V10
+ ROUTER S10
+ MICRONETWORKS / LEGO / POCKET
+ WORLD / DOMAIN LAYERS
+ EVIDENCE / CHECKPOINT / PROVENANCE
```

S1-S10 is one controlled training/evaluation process inside this ecosystem, not the entire system.

## Published public research portal

The public portal is published as a sanitized research front door. The repository source is [`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html). It exposes recorded evidence and claim boundaries, not ROOT execution or private implementation.

## Reviewer access boundary

```text
PUBLIC PORTAL / REVIEWER
= sanitized status / evidence / allowed questions
!= ROOT
!= arbitrary mission execution
!= runtime configuration write access
```

## What reviewers should not infer

Do not infer:

- physical drone validation;
- physical rescue-robot validation;
- physical humanoid validation;
- safety certification;
- live autonomous financial-account execution;
- independent external replication;
- universal superiority of SSI, V10, S10 or any V1-V4 configuration;
- production readiness;
- AGI or consciousness.
